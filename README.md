# F1 Aero Visualization

An interactive OpenGL-based visualization tool for Formula 1 aerodynamics, designed to help understand the complex airflow dynamics and aerodynamic principles that govern modern F1 car performance.

## Features



- Interactive 3D Visualization: Real-time OpenGL rendering of F1 car aerodynamics
- Airflow Simulation: Visual representation of airflow patterns around car components
- Downforce Analysis: Visualization of downforce generation from wings and underbody
- DRS System: Interactive demonstration of Drag Reduction System effects
- Ground Effect: Simulation of modern F1 ground effect aerodynamics
- Wake Turbulence: Visualization of disturbed airflow behind cars
